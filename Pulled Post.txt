Wait, what generation of FUCKING RETARDED did you come from?

The MOST... MOST people Red99 had was 250 when it was FIRST released.

And Blue 1999 was at 200 because it was new, and people wanted to play on a brand new server. But over the first few weeks, when The BLUE folks realized they would get shit rolled by the douchebags that exploited to 50... they left.

Brought population to 100.

Then the fucking dumassery GM involvement (Amelinda, Rogean et al), banning Holocaust, and ignoring the RMT Factory Nihilum (after they [the hacking group, Lovely, et al] disbanded from IF and joined Nacho and his Box group), the server went to the fucking shitter. People realized it was a JOKE. A JOKE.

The sheer fact Rogean, who campaigned for a LEGIT PVP Project 1999 on the boards for a long while before it was released, being COMPLETELY FUCKING NON-EXISTANT since the Holo banning, proves he gives 0 fucks about this box. As long as he made dollaz from it, he gives 0 fucks.

This is irrefutable. He made money, he gives 0 fucks.

Just Let Go.
